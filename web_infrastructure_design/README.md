### OSI Model Overview

The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers. 
Each layer serves a specific function and interacts with the layers directly above and below it.

1. **Physical Layer:**
Deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission and reception of raw
binary data over a physical medium. It includes hardware components and protocols like Ethernet
for wired connections and Wi-Fi for wireless connections.

2. **Data Link Layer:** 
Provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes. 
It also detects and corrects errors that may occur in the Physical layer. Common protocols include
Ethernet for local area networks (LANs) and the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for direct connections.

3. **Network Layer:**
Handles the routing of data packets across multiple nodes and networks. It includes the Internet
Protocol (IP), along with routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP which is responsible for packet
forwarding and routing through intermediate routers.


4. **Transport Layer:**
Provides reliable, transparent transfer of data between end systems.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are crucial here, with TCP 
offering reliability and flow control, and UDP offering a connectionless service for applications 
that require speed over reliability.

5. **Session Layer:**
Manages sessions between end-users, providing mechanisms for opening, closing, and managing a session
between end-user application processes. Protocols include NetBIOS and RPC.

6. **Presentation Layer:** 
Translates data between the application layer and the network format. 
It ensures data from the application layer is readable by the network (and vice versa), providing data
encryption and compression as necessary. Protocols include SSL/TLS for encryption.

7. **Application Layer:** 
The closest to the end user, this layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating
component. Protocols include HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, FTP for files and DNS for domain resolution.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TCP/IP Model Overview

The TCP/IP model is a more practical model used in real networks, consisting of four layers:

1. **Link Layer (Network Interface Layer):**
Corresponds to the OSI's Physical and Data Link layers, handling physical and data link challenges like
physical addressing and media access control.

2. **Internet Layer:**
Equivalent to the OSI's Network layer, it's responsible for packet forwarding and routing.
IP is a principal protocol in this layer, along with ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for error
reporting.

3. **Transport Layer:**
Similar to the OSI's Transport layer, it includes TCP for reliable communication and UDP for faster,
connectionless communication.

4. **Application Layer:**
Combines the functions of OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers.
It supports application-level protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and DNS.
